The p-value obtained from an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test, as indicated by your F_onewayResult, doesn't directly represent correlation. Instead, it assesses whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of two or more groups.

In the context of ANOVA:
Null Hypothesis (H0): Assumes that the means of the groups are equal.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Suggests that at least one group mean is different from the others.
The p-value associated with the ANOVA test indicates the probability of observing the given test statistic (F-statistic) or more extreme values under the null hypothesis. Therefore, a low p-value (< 0.05) typically suggests that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there are statistically significant differences between the group means.
The p-value doesn't provide information about the strength or direction of the relationship between variables (which is what correlation measures), but rather it indicates whether there are differences in means that are unlikely to occur by random chance alone.
